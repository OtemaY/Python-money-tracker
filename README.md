## INTRODUCTION
A program that helps to track money. 
The program calculates the hours spent on a task; it estimates a user's time spent on projects by recording the start and end times for the task. 
It then calculates the amount of money made tackling the task. Time entered and information from the program is stored in a csv or excel file for future referencing.


## PROCESS
- Defining the Problem 
- Analysing the requirements 
- Writing the program 
- Testing the program 
- Deploying the Program



## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND LIBRARIES
We used python language to write the entire program. We heavily relied on datetime library to capture the system date and time as well as time computation. We also used the csv module to pass the information captured into a csv file

## INSTALLATION
-The program was developed with python 3 and is compatible with Windows, Mac OS and Linux.
